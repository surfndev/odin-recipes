    <h3>Description:)</h3>
    <p>No two aglio e olio recipes are alike, but this one is pretty true to the classic method. The key is slowly toasting the garlic slices to a perfect golden brown in the olive oil.</p>
    <p>If it's too light, you don't get the full flavor and if it's too dark it gets bitter. My advice? Do it perfectly.</p>

        <li>Gather all ingredients. </li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 10 to 12 minutes. Drain and transfer to a pasta bowl.</li>

        <li>Cook over medium heat to slowly toast garlic, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low when olive oil begins to bubble. Cook and stir until garlic is golden brown, about another 5 minutes. Remove from heat. </li>
        <li>Stir red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper into pasta. </li>
        <li>Pour in hot olive oil and garlic, and sprinkle on Italian parsley and half of the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese; toss until combined. </li>
        <li>Serve pasta topped with the remaining Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. </li>
